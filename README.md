 Public repository of matan hack telegram bot

[![firefox_wFTr9lXz6e.png](readme_files/logo.png)](https://t.me/MatanHackBot)

You can find bot by this [link](https://t.me/MatanHackBot) or by tap a picture above

##Description

In our bot, you can get screenshots of tasks in mathematical analysis or linear algebra from moodle. 
But every test has a price. This is not real money, but only virtual coins that you spend on opening tasks. You can get coins either by sending your screenshots or by inviting friends.

We want to announce that now, instead of a dozen channels and chats, we will have only one bot - 
[@MatanHackBot](https://t.me/MatanHackBot) üòä

There you can find all our old screenshots that we have saved this remote year, as well as, of course, 
send your own üòÅ

Since many people just look at the answers, but do not share theirs, we have introduced a system of 
coins in the bot. This is done to stimulate you and develop our project.

It's simple - when you upload your screenshots - you get coins, and when you look at other people's - 
spend them!

We tried to make the bot as simple as possible, but if you suddenly have questions, you can ask them 
in our [chat](https://t.me/joinchat/SJxTqarixuOn_sOx) using the "write to admins" button in the bot 
menu, or using our [old offer bot](http://t.me/Predlozhka4Bot) - it will still work for a while :)

All successful studies and good mood, do not forget to invite your friends to get even more coinsüòò

Well, I would also like to say that at first the bot will work in test mode. Please report all bugs 
to us (via the menu button "write to admins" or the [old bot-offer](http://t.me/Predlozhka4Bot))
